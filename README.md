# Classroom-COVID-Model
Simple model to model quarantine cases for different seating arrangements in a normal 30 desk Social Studies classroom.
To mimic a specific student having COVID, click on them to change their color to blue.
Any students that need to quarantine then will turn crimson (determining whether a student needs to quarantine is based on CDC guideline of 6 feet).
To remove a student click on a student twice (or once if they're already blue).
You can also generate random arrangements of students or find the best arrangement of 100.
